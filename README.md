# Presentation: The Role of Bioreactors in Tissue Engineering
## (And Using Jupyter Notebooks to Teach the Fundamental Concepts of Bioreactors and Mass Transfer More Effectively)

This repository contains the LaTeX source files of my presentation at KU Leuven in November 2018. The presentation is available to view using the online Jupyter viewer at [this link](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mbarzegary/presentation_bioreactors2018/blob/master/presentation.pdf) (generated using nbviewer.jupyter.org).

The objective of this presentation is to have a general overview of the bioreactors and their crucial role in Tissue Engineering, and then, dive into the mathematical modeling of such complex systems. Because it is important for engineering sciences students understand the fundamental concepts of these systems, in addition to mentioned content, taking advantage of Jupyter Notebooks is also proposed as a part of this presentation, which enables instructors to teach mathematical and computational foundations of physical systems more effectively.
